## April 20: Regularization Demo

To see the outputs without having to run anything, just download the `.html` file and open it in your browser.

If you want to be able to run the notebook and edit it, download the `.ipynb` file. You can either run it locally with [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/install), or upload it to [Google colaboratory](http://colab.research.google.com/).
